# Advent of Code

The [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun programming challenge that happens every year starting on December 1st. This is my repo of solutions.

## How to view/run code

Each folder represents a year. Each year, I try to change things up a bit (my main goal is to finish the entire event). So, each folder usually has a different way of running the solutions.

I've tried to include a `scripts` folder in each year (meant to be run within the year's folder). These scripts usually have a `watch.sh` or `run.sh` script that will run a given day's code.

You can use these scripts to try and get a sense of how to set up your environment. If you're lucky, I'll also have a `README.md` in the year's folder that may have additional details to  my environment set up.
