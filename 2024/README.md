# 2024

## Tools

### Solution Execution

This year I'm using Deno 2. Set-up should be pretty simple (unless its the
future, then... good luck.)

`deno run -A [path-to-ts-file]` should work.

### Testing Framework

I'm using `deno test` for the testing setup

### 3rd party dependencies

I am trying to limit my use of any 3rd party libraries. This should make things
simple to set up.

## Goals

My main goal this year is just to finish the challenges.

Beyond that, I wanted to check out `deno`. I also haven't programmed much in
`javascript` over the last year (I don't think I've done any Typescript), so
returning to the language should be fun!
